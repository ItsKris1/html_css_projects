            <p id="tribute-info">John Winston Ono Lennon achieved worldwide fame as the founder, co-lead vocalist, and rhythm
            guitarist of the Beatles. His songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney remains the most successful in history.[3] In
            1969, he started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, Yoko Ono. After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon
            continued his career as a solo artist and as Ono's collaborator.</p>

            <p class="box-text">Lennon was born at Liverpool Maternity Hospital to Julia (née Stanley) (1914–1958) and Alfred Lennon (1912–1976). Alfred
            was a merchant seaman of Irish descent who was away at the time of his son's birth.[4] His parents named him John

            established by Lennon in September 1956.[35] By the summer of 1957, the Quarrymen played a "spirited set of songs" made

            <h3 class="box-title">Solo career: 1970–1980</h3>
            <p class="box-text">In 1970, Lennon and Ono went through primal therapy with Arthur Janov in Los Angeles, California. Designed to release
            emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for four months; he had wanted
            to treat the couple for longer, but they felt no need to continue and returned to London.[106] Lennon's debut solo
            album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), was received with praise by many music critics, but its highly personal
            lyrics and stark sound limited its commercial performance</p>

            before leaving The Dakota with Ono for a recording session at the Record Plant.[164] After the session, Lennon and Ono
            returned to their Manhattan apartment in a limousine at around 10:50 p.m. EST.</p>
